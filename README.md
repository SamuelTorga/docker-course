# docker-course

A project related to the course https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-kubernetes-the-practical-guide where all the exercises will be published.

There is a `main.sh` bash script in some exercises that, besides running the commands, also serves as a form of documentation.

Don't forget to check the final project in [10-final-project](10-final-project)
