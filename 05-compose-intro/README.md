# 05 - Compose Intro

A project that serves as an introduction to the Docker Compose subject. We use the same backend and frontend apps that were developed earlier and use Docker Compose to configure their containers.

## Notes
- To force a image rebuild you add `--build` to docker-compose command. Obviously it works only on images created by us.
